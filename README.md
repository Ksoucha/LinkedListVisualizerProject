# LinkedListVisualizerProject

## **Objective**

This project focuses on the following aspects: **linked lists, dynamic memory allocation, C++ classes and OpenFrameworks animation**. It is an interactive visualization of a **linked list** where nodes are visually represented and animated.

### **Project Overview**

1. Each linked list node is displayed as a **circle** connected to the next node with a **line**.
2. Each node **displays a number**, which also determines the **size of the circle** (e.g., radius of a circle).
3. The linked list starts with just a **head node**.
4. The user can **modify the linked list dynamically**:
    - Press **Q** to insert a node **at the head**.
    - Press **W** to insert a node **at the tail**.
    - Press **A** to delete the **head** node.
    - Press **S** to delete the **tail** node.
    - Press **E** to sort the linked list in ascending order.
    - Each new node is assigned a **random number**.
5. Nodes have a simple **oscillating animation**, making them move like a **snake**.
6. The user can **adjust the animation properties**:
    - Press **Z** to **increase** the oscillation amplitude.
    - Press **X** to **decrease** the oscillation amplitude.
7. The user can **pan the camera**:
    - Press **left arrow** to pan the view **left**.
    - Press **right arrow** to pan the view **right**.
